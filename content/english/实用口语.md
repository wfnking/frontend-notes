### fart

I just farted, and it stinks really bad. 我刚刚放屁了，真的好臭。

### fit in 合得来；适应

It's no surprise she's leaving - she never really fitted in. 她要离开——这一点也
不意外，因为她从来都没有真正融入过。


### fell open

1. When they told her grandmother they were getting married in six weeks, her mouth fell open.

2. When she told me the news, my mouth fell open. I couldn’t think of a thing to say to her.
